# GEDCOM CHARACTER MAP GRAPHS

This seems like a great tool to keep up with a book's characters and main events chapter by chapter. This project is able to read GEDCOM files and map out in a graph each person inside it, along with all of its deatails, name, events, sex, notes and quotes. The goal is to be able to easily craft Character Maps for literary works that have complex plots with character-webbing, and be able to keep up with the progress of each chapter accordignly. The GEDCOM files can then be imported into geneaolgy software if the user wants to, but they are supposed to be kept simple and strictly referring to the GEDCOM standard (without the extra complex notations of Gramps or other genealogy software).

The `index.html` file proposes a website in which one selects a `*.ged` file, and then the script `graph.js` will process it into a graph using `d3js` that can be searched and dragged around.

## Main Features

1. Search for any person in the graph
1. Click on a node to show exclusively neighbors (direct relationships)
1. Hover over a relationship link to look at the specifc relationship and any notes that may go alongside it
1. Hover over a node (person) to see its details, full names and nicknames, sex, birth, death, notes, events and quotes.

## Features I Want To Implement

1. The script should be able to show correctly `.ged` files generated by GRAMPS, since it's easier to input info that way.

## Good to know

1. This sofware was completely made with AI, I do not know a thing about JavaScript. Any PRs that I do will probably come from prompting AI and receiving code and features.
1. The `.ged` files chapter by chapter for `Three Body Problem` have been generated by AI aswell. I gave it each chapter in a text file and used specific prompts to make it give back .ged structured data that closely follows the plot of the book. This seems like a great tool to keep up with a book's characters and main events chapter by chapter. That's what makes this tool useful.
1. I made this in a day, so don't expect nice code or anything. It's purely a functional tool.
1. Have fun
